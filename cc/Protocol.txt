Cache covert channel simple protocol description
================================================

Ursescu Ionut - DCC project

Physical layer
==============

Based on FLUSH+RELOAD on LLC cache. Finding the probing/eviction address sets
for sender and receiver. Flush the L1 cache on sender and probe on receiver.
When cache hit ratio < 0.5 that means we have a `1` (we flushed most of the time)
otherwise we have a `0` (no one flushed the data from cache).

In order to make it work over the system, flushes need to be synchronized with probings.
Using the wall timer to sync the receiver with the sender (global availlable information in a system on 
different VM or different processes).

Note:

By nature the sender will not be able to receive anything because of the
busy loop flushing the address set. Same thing on the receiver. Can be avoided by implementing
on multiple threads, but that would will require careful placement of threads on the system cores.

For this implementation we assume that the communication is half-duplex.
